# Update your Jacquard tag

If you have just bought your Jacquard product and using it out of the
box, your tag requires a firmware update.

## Recommended firmware update method

Once you have set a valid API key in the `SDKConfig` instance used to
initialize `JacquardManagerImplementation` (see [this
page](cloud-api-terms.html) for details on obtaining an API Key) the
SDK will apply any required firmware updates when your tag connects.

update your tag's firmware using the instructions below.
