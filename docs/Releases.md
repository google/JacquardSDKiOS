## Versioning

The Jacquard SDK uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). The
main goal and property of Semantic Versioning is to give users of an SDK the
safety of upgrading knowing what versions will and will not break code
compatibility.

In summary:

> Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
>
> 1.  MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
>
> 2.  MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner,
>     and
>
> 3.  PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes. Additional
>     labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to
>     the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
