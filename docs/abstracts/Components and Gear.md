In addition to the Jacquard Tag, all Jacquard Threads products have some additional hardware that communicates with the [Jacquard Threads](https://atap.google.com/jacquard/technology/).
While your app will not interact with this hardware directly, it will observe when the tag is inserted into that product (you may see the documentation call this "gear attachment") and
inspect metadata to determine the capabilities of that product.
