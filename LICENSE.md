    3.1 Subject to the terms of the License Agreement, Google grants you a
        limited, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive,
        and non-sublicensable license to use the SDK solely to develop
        applications to be used solely with the Google Jacquard hardware
        components and accessories.
        
    3.2 You may not use this SDK to develop applications for other
        platforms (including non-compatible implementations of Jacquard)
        or to develop another SDK.
        
    3.3 You agree that Google or third parties own all legal right, title
        and interest in and to the SDK, including any Intellectual
        Property Rights that subsist in the SDK. "Intellectual Property
        Rights" means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law,
        trade secret law, trademark law, and any and all other proprietary
        rights. Google reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.
    
    3.4 You may not use the SDK for any purpose not expressly permitted by
        the License Agreement.  Except to the extent required by applicable
        third party licenses, you may not copy (except for backup purposes),
        modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble,
        or create derivative works of the SDK or any part of the SDK.
    
    3.5 Use, reproduction and distribution of components of the SDK
        licensed under an open source software license are governed solely by
        the terms of that open source software license and not the License
        Agreement.
    
    3.6 You agree that the form and nature of the SDK that Google provides
        may change without prior notice to you and that future versions of the
        SDK may be incompatible with applications developed on previous
        versions of the SDK. You agree that Google may stop (permanently or
        temporarily) providing the SDK (or any features within the SDK) to you
        or to users generally at Google's sole discretion, without prior
        notice to you.
    
    3.7 Nothing in the License Agreement gives you a right to use any of

        limited, revocable, royalty-free license for the sole purpose of
        reviewing the Sample App to create and build your own “app”.
    
4. Use of the SDK by You
    
    4.1 You agree to use the SDK and write applications only for purposes
        that are permitted by (a) the License Agreement and (b) any applicable
        law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the
        relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of
        data or software to and from the United States or other relevant
        countries).
    
    4.2 You agree that if you use the SDK to develop applications for
        general public users, you will protect the privacy and legal rights of
        those users in accordance with applicable law. If the users provide
        you with user names, passwords, or other login information or personal
        information, you must make the users aware that the information will
        be available to your application, and you must provide legally
        adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. If your
        application stores personal or sensitive information provided by
        users, it must do so securely and in accordance with applicable
        law. If the user provides your application with Google Account
        information, your application may only use that information to access
        the user's Google Account when, and for the limited purposes for
        which, the user has given you permission to do so.
    
    4.3 You agree that you will not engage in any activity with the SDK,
        including the development or distribution of an application, that
        interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an unauthorized
        manner the servers, networks, or other properties or services of any
        third party including, but not limited to, Google or any mobile
        communications carrier.
    
    4.4 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has
        no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any data, content,
        or resources that you create, transmit or display through the Jacquard
        SDK and/or applications for Jacquard, and for the consequences of your
        actions (including any loss or damage which Google may suffer) by
        doing so.
    
    4.5 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Google has
        no responsibility to you or to any third party for) any breach of your
        obligations under the License Agreement, any applicable third party
        contract or Terms of Service, or any applicable law or regulation, and
        for the consequences (including any loss or damage which Google or any
        third party may suffer) of any such breach.
    
5.  Privacy and Information
    
    5.1 Through the [Jacquard] SDK, Google does not collect or store any
        personal information.
    
6. Third Party Applications
    
    6.1 If you use the SDK to run applications developed by a third party
        or that access data, content or resources provided by a third party,
        you agree that Google is not responsible for those applications, data,
        content, or resources. You understand that all data, content or
        resources which you may access through such third party applications
        are the sole responsibility of the person from which they originated
        and that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that you may
        experience as a result of the use or access of any of those third
        party applications, data, content, or resources.
    
    6.2 You should be aware the data, content, and resources presented to
        you through such a third party application may be protected by
        intellectual property rights which are owned by the providers (or by
        other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent,
        lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on
        these data, content, or resources (either in whole or in part) unless
        you have been specifically given permission to do so by the relevant
        owners.
    
    6.3 You acknowledge that your use of such third party applications,
        data, content, or resources may be subject to separate terms between
        you and the relevant third party. In that case, the License Agreement
        does not affect your legal relationship with these third parties.
    
    6.4 Feedback. Google may from time to time receive suggestions,
        feedback or other information from You concerning the SDK.  Any
        suggestions, feedback or other disclosures made by You are and shall
        be entirely voluntary on Your part. Notwithstanding any other term in
        this Agreement, Google and its licensors shall be free to use Your
        suggestions, feedback or other information in the further development
        of the SDK, without obligation of any kind to You. You agree that all
        inventions, product improvements, and modifications to the SDK
        conceived of or made by Google and/or its licensors that are based,
        either in whole or in part, on Your ideas, feedback, suggestions, or
        recommended improvements are the exclusive property of Google and/or
        its licensors, and all right, title and interest in and to any such
        inventions, product improvements, and modifications will vest solely
        in Google and/or its licensors, as the case may be.  7. Terminating
        this License Agreement
        
7. Terminating this License Agreement
    
    7.1 The License Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by
        either you or Google as set out below.
    
    7.2 If you want to terminate the License Agreement, you may do so by
        ceasing your use of the SDK and any relevant developer credentials.
    
    7.3 Google may at any time, terminate the License Agreement with you
        if:

        Google is required to do so by law; or (C) the partner with whom
        Google offered certain parts of SDK (such as APIs) to you has
        terminated its relationship with Google or ceased to offer certain
        parts of the SDK to you; or (D) Google decides to no longer provide
        the SDK or certain parts of the SDK to users in the country in which
        you are resident or from which you use the service, or the provision
        of the SDK or certain SDK services to you by Google is, in Google's
        sole discretion, no longer commercially viable.
    
    7.4 When the License Agreement comes to an end, all of the legal
        rights, obligations and liabilities that you and Google have benefited
        from, been subject to (or which have accrued over time whilst the
        License Agreement has been in force) or which are expressed to
        continue indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the
        provisions of paragraph 12.7 shall continue to apply to such rights,
        obligations and liabilities indefinitely.
    
8. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES
    
    8.1 YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SDK IS AT
        YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE"

    8.2 YOUR USE OF THE SDK AND ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE
        OBTAINED THROUGH THE USE OF THE SDK IS AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK
        AND YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM
        OR OTHER DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH USE.
    
    8.3 GOOGLE FURTHER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS
        OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO

        CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY YOU,
        INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF DATA, WHETHER OR NOT GOOGLE OR ITS
        REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE
        POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.
    
10. Indemnification
    
    10.1 To the maximum extent permitted by law, you agree to defend,

         use of the SDK, (b) any application you develop on the SDK that
         infringes any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent
         or other intellectual property right of any person or defames any
         person or violates their rights of publicity or privacy, and (c) any
         non-compliance by you with the License Agreement.
    
11. Changes to the License Agreement

         between you and Google and governs your use of the SDK (excluding any
         services which Google may provide to you under a separate written
         agreement), and completely replaces any prior agreements between you
         and Google in relation to the SDK.
    
    12.2 You agree that if Google does not exercise or enforce any legal
         right or remedy which is contained in the License Agreement (or which
         Google has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be
         taken to be a formal waiver of Google's rights and that those rights
         or remedies will still be available to Google.
    
    12.3 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this
         matter, rules that any provision of the License Agreement is invalid,
         then that provision will be removed from the License Agreement without
         affecting the rest of the License Agreement. The remaining provisions
         of the License Agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable.
    
    12.4 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of
         companies of which Google is the parent shall be third party
         beneficiaries to the License Agreement and that such other companies
         shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of
         the License Agreement that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor
         of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be third
         party beneficiaries to the License Agreement.
    
    12.5 EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. THE SDK IS SUBJECT TO UNITED STATES EXPORT
         LAWS AND REGULATIONS. YOU MUST COMPLY WITH ALL DOMESTIC AND
         INTERNATIONAL EXPORT LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE SDK. THESE
         LAWS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON DESTINATIONS, END USERS AND END USE.
    
    12.6 The rights granted in the License Agreement may not be assigned
         or transferred by either you or Google without the prior written
         approval of the other party. Neither you nor Google shall be permitted
         to delegate their responsibilities or obligations under the License
         Agreement without the prior written approval of the other party.
    
    12.7 The License Agreement, and your relationship with Google under
         the License Agreement, shall be governed by the laws of the State of
         California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and
         Google agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
         located within the county of Santa Clara, California to resolve any
         legal matter arising from the License Agreement. Notwithstanding this,
         you agree that Google shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive
         remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any
         jurisdiction.

      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
