# Jacquard iOS SDK

Jacquardâ„¢ by Google weaves new digital experiences into the things you
love, wear, and use every day to give you the power to do more and be
more.  Jacquard SDK is a way to connect Jacquard interactions within
your apps.  Create an app and bring it to life with swipes and taps
through the Jacquard SDK.

# What do I need to get started?

The iOS Jacquard SDK supports iOS versions 13 and greater.

You will need the Jacquard Tag with a supported Jacquard product (all
come with one tag). Currently supported products are:

* Levi's Trucker Jacket
* Samsonite Konnect-i backpack
* Saint Laurent Cit-e Backpack

You can find links to purchase these products on the [Google Jacquard
website](https://atap.google.com/jacquard/products/).

> If you have just opened a new retail Jacquard product, your tag
> probably needs a firmware update (and perhaps charging). Review the
> steps in the [Updating Firmware](updating-firmware.html) page.
